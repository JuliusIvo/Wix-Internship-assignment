# Wix-Internship-assignment
A plain java project created for an assignment to an internship at wix.com

The goal of the assignment is to create a project which fetches data from a url, more specifically a json object.
Then the json object is essentially treated as an excel spreadsheet.
The data is processed as is required in the description of the assignment, then it is sent back to the url provided, and receives a response - the response being a submission code.
